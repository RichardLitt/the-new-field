      <p>It was green and wide, and dotted with tiny white flowers. The sky was mostly clear, though I could see clouds in the distance.</p>
      <p>To the east lay the Grand Mountains, a range of peaks stretching north hundreds of miles from the shores of the Camreon Ocean until they slowly gave way to the endless verdant fields of the Plains of Armok.</p>
