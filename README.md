The New Field
=============

A collaborative story attempt. 

Members:_See the commit logs_
 
Our commits tell stories; the links we follow trace trails in the web. We are makers, and we are movers, and we are doers. We work best when we help each other. Why shouldn't we then tell stories with each other?

Some groundrules:

 * All groundrules have to be agreed upon by everyone.
 * All rules previously established stand for new members until they are taken down by all of the members.
 * You can change anything. Use humility to know when this doesn't apply. 
 * If you have an idea, work it in. 
 * No using the wiki or pages or private notes. Bring it all to the table, here. 
 * Work collaboratively, share, talk, invite, spread, disseminate, take ownership.
 * We are bound by nothing written down, but only by what we can build up. 
 * Have some fucking fun, you asshole. 
 
Let's see what we do. 

Ideas
--------

####RichardLitt:  

 * Perhaps a modular story? Where we can autogenerate storylines that would
   make it appear static, but are made up of chapters put together in a
random way? This would require small, modular chapters, and a story line
that would work - such as a travelogue (islands? Mountains?)  
 * Some new take on hyperlinking, perhaps? Where hovering over a link
   causes javascript to modify the remaining page or the storyline,
instead of just static paragraphs.  

####Simon:  

 * Some story made after the global ecopaclypse.
